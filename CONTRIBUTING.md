#### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to  [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com "JavaScript Standard Style").

Prefer the object spread operator ({...anotherObj}) to Object.assign()
Inline exports with expressions whenever possible
// Use this:
export default class ClassName {

}

// Instead of:
class ClassName {

}
export default ClassName
Place requires in the following order:
Built in Node Modules (such as path)
Built in Atom and Electron Modules (such as atom, remote)
Local Modules (using relative paths)
Place class properties in the following order:
Class methods and properties (methods starting with static)
Instance methods and properties
Avoid platform-dependent code
